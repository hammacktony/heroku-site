Mr. President,

I am writing this letter to you to address some of the comments you made behind closed doors during an immigration meeting.

You said that "we do not need more people from shithole countries." You were implying that countries in Africa or places like Haiti were shitholes.

Sir, I would have to counter that argument.

First, although Haiti and some African countries may not have the Manhattan skyline, Mar-a-Lago, or a plethora of buildings that do not have “Trump” on them; those countries are not as "backwoods" as you may think. I have friends from the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Kenya; those people are not less intelligent nor less human than us Americans. For you to say that is not only incorrect but ignorant.

You claim that you want to "Make America Great Again" yet you fail to recognize that America was created by immigrants. The Pilgrims were people that fled political and religious persecution in England. They sought solace in the New World, to build a new life. Why do you think Haitians, Mexicans, Syrians, and many other people groups want to come to America? We offer a unique opportunity to live a life free from religious persecution, to live a life with guaranteed rights, and to make your own future. That is what makes America great, not isolating ourselves from "undesirables."

A <a href="http://time.com/4108606/history-american-immigrants/">Time Magazine</a> article points to some of the most notable and influential immigrants that came to the US:
* Joseph Pulitzer - Journalist (Hungary)
* Madeline Albright - First Female Secretary of State (then Czechoslovakia, now Czech Republic)
* Jerry Yang - Founder of Yahoo! (China)

A <a href="https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/bet-you-didnt-know-these-game-changers-were-immigr/">Global Citizen</a> article lists other influential immigrants:
* Albert Einstein - General and Special Relativity amongst many other achievements (Germany)
* Sergey Brin - Co-Founder of Google (Russia)
* Dikembe Mutombo - One of the greatest shot blockers in NBA history (Democratic Republic of Congo)
* Jan Koum - Founder of Whatsapp (Ukrainian Soviet Union)
* Arianna Huffington - Co-Founder of Huffington Post (Greece)

Secondly, you put down these other countries without realizing that we and some of our most important allies were also undesirable countries.

The English viewed the American colonies as "shitholes." The colonies were a cog in the British Empire's economic machine. Raw materials were harvested and then sent to England for manufacturing where those goods were then sold back to the colonies with a high markup price. We were able to liberate ourselves from British oppression and create a system to ensure each and every right.

In the eyes of the other world powers at the time, America was a "shithole" country; look how far we have come!

Australia was first a prison colony for the British. Germany was once a collection of separated states that warred against each other. Canada essentially went through the same process as America did. Until the signing of the Magna Carta, England was a hopeless country with many a hopeless kings that did nothing but stifle freedoms of the British and hampered growth of England.

Mr. President, I am highly disappointed, nay disgusted, with your choice of words describing fellow humans in other countries and at home. Sir, you are an embarrassment to the Presidency. You are making a mockery of Americans and our values. Your "show of strength" is a really a sign of weakness. You speak with the language of a bully and the temperment of a 5 year old. You embarrass America when you needlessly harass others on Twitter who disagree with you.

You sir are a racist and a sexist (either intentionally or not), and it pains me that you are my president, that you represent America. If you do not change, America will never recover that "greatness" that you claim we have ''lost." It is because of you and people from your generation who have sat idly by and oppressed the disenfranchised, refused to help those that need help, silenced the struggling, reduced women to objects, and failed to invest in the next generation that has caused America to be less than what it could be. You sir are the problem, and yet you cannot see it.

I hope you change your ways. Not for your sake, but for this country's.
Having people wanting to be immigrants of the United States is a good issue to have, especially with the amount of people trying to enter; for it means that people want to come to this great country and live with the freedoms and benefits of an American. We should be flattered that so many knock on the door for entry and not be disgusted by their skin tone, religious practices, or country of origin.

What is even more ironic is for you to say these things and then attend a MLK event! Your recent (and not so recent) hate speech is in direct opposition of MLK’s dream: “I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed : ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.’”

Mr. President, many Americans do not care if you are a successful politician, we care that you are a decent man. Be decent Mr. President. That is all we ask of you.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Citizen
