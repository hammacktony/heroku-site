                <p>One of my projects is the "Batman Universe Comic News Aggregator." This uses BeautifulSoup4 to scour eight of the top comic news sites for Batman-related articles. It displays the first three pages of results of each site.</p>

                <p>The eight news sites currently supported: bleedingcool.com, cbr.com, comicbook.com, comicsbeat.com, ign.com, nerdist.com, newsarama.com, and theouthousers.com.</p>

                <p>This project accesses a Postgres database to receive the output of scraped information.</p>

                <p>My second project is "An Interactive Map of Active Volcanoes Classified by Last Known Eruption Date." When the KÄ«lauea volcano erupted in May, I wondered where else were active volcanoes. After much searching, I realized there was not a  map of active volcanoes. The heavy work to create the map is found <a href="https://github.com/hammacktony/python-projects/tree/master/volcanos">here</a>.</p>
